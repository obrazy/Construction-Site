# Construction Site

This is the Latios Framework development Unity Project. It is a space for
collaborative development on disruptive redesigns and breaking changes. If this
is ongoing development in this repo, expect to open up the project and be met
with compiler errors.

Development here is usually coordinated over the framework’s discord server. If
you’d like to be involved in either development of a major breaking change, or
help want to build test cases for the breaking changes, reach out there.

Ongoing projects:

-   QVVS System Redesign (V2)
